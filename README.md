# Analysis of tumor growth in mice

Using plots nalysis using the data of 259 mice with SCC tumor growth, who were treted using various drug regimes.



Observations and Insights
Three observations that we can see in this analisis are the following
Taking as reference one mice, their tumor volume reduces as time passes when using Capomulin, which means that is it is a reliable drug.
According to the line regression plot, we can see that as the mice's weight increases, the volume of the tumor also increases.
According to the bar plots, more mice (approximately 100 more) were treated using Capomulin and Ramicane, which is probably telling 
us that those were the most effective drugs since they were used in a bigger population.
